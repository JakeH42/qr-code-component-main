## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Clamp for dynamic spacing
- Custom CSS utility classes
- BEM - Block Element Modifier class naming convention 

### What I learned

I learnt that CSS has a 'font' shorthand that takes the following values:
	•	font-style
	•	font-variant
	•	font-weight
	•	font-size (required)
	•	line-height (optional, but paired with font-size using /)
	•	font-family (required)

### Continued development

I need to realise where to use utility classes instead of styling directly on the component itself for best practices in terms of scalability.

I need to understand GitHub and Git better - in particular how to setup repos, how to do branches and how to submit code for review as I realise this is important for team collaboration.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/ ) - CSS Reset by Eric Meyer - I will use this going forward as it is super simple and sets the stage nicely for custom CSS
